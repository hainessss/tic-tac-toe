# Designs

The final designs have arrived! (We've shared them as PDFs in this folder.)

> **Note:** We've included "combined" (all one sheet) and "individual" (separate pages) PDFs. We suspect the individual may be easier to deal with, but the combined includes labels for each page, so it's probably the best place to start.

Unfortunately, we noticed some issues:

### Changes

These new designs clash in some places with the earlier wireframes we used for our prototype:

- The header is no longer global.
- The logo has changed
- Dropdown square selection has changed to on-click square selection.

And even more. Oh well.

### Some Inconsistencies

Just scanning the design files, we see a couple places where:

- Some font sizes/weights don't seem to be listed in the Design Guide
- Some style patterns aren't clear.
- Some items don't seem perfectly centered, or it isn't clear how they should look.

### Lack of Guidance

We're particularly unsure how winning/stalemate conditions work, given that the designs show two separate pages for both stalemate and win conditions. We're guessing they're meant to be combined, not chosen between.

Unfortunately, the designer's currently tied up on another project, so you'll have to use your best judgment for this and other questions until we hear back.

Good luck!
